Instructions
------------

Dragging the mouse left and right or using the arrow keys moves the coverflow . Double-clicking or pressing the return key launches the video centered in the coverflow.

One or more directories can be chosen with Ctrl+O. Upon first running the application, you will be prompted to pick one or more directories.

Fine-grained control is available to those willing to edit ~/.video-coverflow/config.ini (this file is generated after running and closing the application once).

* PySide
* PyOpenGL
