Instructions
------------

One or more directories can be chosen using the open button in the top-left of the application window.

Dragging the mouse left and right or using the arrow keys moves the coverflow. Double-clicking or pressing the return key launches the video centered in the coverflow.

The text-box in the top-right of the application window can be used to search for titles.

Fine-grain control is available to those willing to edit ~/.video-coverflow/config.ini (this file is generated after running and closing the application once).

Requirements
------------

To run video-coverflow, you will need:

* PySide
* PyOpenGL
