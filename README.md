Instructions
------------

To run video-coverflow, you will need:

* PySide
* PyOpenGL

A directory can be chosen with Ctrl+O. Upon first running the application, you will be prompted to pick a directory. Multiple directories can be picked by editing ~/.video-coverflow/config.ini (this will be a GUI feature in the future).

Dragging the mouse left and right moves the coverflow. Double-clicking launches the video centered in the coverflow.
